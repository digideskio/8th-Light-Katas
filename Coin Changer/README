The coin changer is a simple Ruby exercise/application that I'm learning to write at my apprenticeship at 8th Light in Chicago. I am simultaneously learning how to use github, so please excuse any mistakes :)

I have no prior coding experience, so I'm hoping to use github to help me track my progress and give others insight into what I am learning.
